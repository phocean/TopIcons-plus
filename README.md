# TopIcons

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nevesnunes/topicons/master/screenshot.png)

An alternative to GNOME Shell's Legacy Tray, making use of the top panel. Icons have adjusted padding and configurable appearance, in order to suit your theme better. By default the extension has custom opacity and saturation settings applied.

## Installation

- Move the extension to <code>~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions</code>
- Reload GNOME Shell with <code>Alt+F2 r Enter</code>
- Enable the extension with *gnome-tweak-tool*

## Compatibility

GNOME Shell 3.16 and up.

## Notes

Icons will have a small delay before appearing on the panel, due to a workaround regarding icon loading. This is a GNOME Shell issue, also reproducable with the Legacy Tray.

## Credits

Many thanks go to Adel Gadllah for making the [original extension](http://94.247.144.115/repo/topicons/) and also to Mjnaderi for the [Toptray fork](https://github.com/mjnaderi/TopTray).
